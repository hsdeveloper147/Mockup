* What has been difficult?

Ans-
1.Nothing seems to be difficult in HTML till now.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Ans-
 --Yes, I have used follwing problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far:-
  1. Looking into syntax on stackoverflow or HTML reference element in MDN.
  2. Whenever I feel low, I try to motivate myself by saying that ''the instructors who are teaching us have reached that level by persistant hardwork, so if I 
     do hardwork and do not fear from hurdles, one day I may become a proeffient web developer''.   
  3. I have aquired a growth mindset instead of static mindset, so problem solving is now a challenge to me than a hurdle.
